<p>It's the 17th and I officially start work today. I've had my weekly meeting with Clint, he'll be my mentor for the summer. We've discussed how I should go about things. I have a Google Doc that I'll be using to roughly track whatever needs to be done. I'll try to keep it as up to date as possible after due discussion with the members of the A-team.</p>
<p>Here's the link to <a href="http://goo.gl/zjjfz">the doc</a> if anyone wants it.</p>
