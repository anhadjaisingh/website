<p>For those of you who didn't know I write a bunch of slightly more technical troubleshoot-sy articles on my other blog, called <a href="http://commandlinelog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>/var/log/misc.log<br />
</strong></a><br />
I'll occasionally link posts from there, like this one, a <a href="http://commandlinelog.wordpress.com/2014/09/25/setting-up-fedora-apache-php-fpm-mpm_event/" target="_blank">HOWTO guide to setting up Apache + PHP-FPM + MPM_Event on Fedora20</a>.</p>
