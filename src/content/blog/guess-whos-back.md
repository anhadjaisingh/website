<p>I haven't updated this blog since my semester started and that isn't particularly a good thing.<br />
Thanks to Gerv's Reminder this blog is now back up and will resume it's cycle of weekly updates.</p>
<p>Although the blog hasn't been updated in a while I <em>have</em> been chipping away at&nbsp;<a href="http://mozbase.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozprocess.html" target="_blank">Mozprocess</a>&nbsp;little by little.<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778267"><br />
</a></p>
<p>It's a module that lends us the ability to kill processes across platforms. Testing involves generating various types of process trees,<br />
And then killing these process trees and checking that this was done correctly.</p>
<p>This endevour doesn't have it's own bug number, instead all work is being done under <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778267" target="_blank">Bug 778267</a>&nbsp;.<br />
I hope to be back with more updates soon!</p>
