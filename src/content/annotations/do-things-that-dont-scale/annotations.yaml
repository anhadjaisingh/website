    type: "inline"
    note: "This is the core insight of the essay. Every successful startup I know did some version of this — whether it was going door to door, cold emailing, or showing up at conferences. The founders who skip this step usually fail because they never develop the tight feedback loop with real users that manual recruiting creates."

    type: "inline"
    note: "This math is what makes the 'do things that don't scale' advice work. You only need to manually recruit the first cohort — after that, compound growth takes over. But you have to actually do the manual work first to prime the pump."
