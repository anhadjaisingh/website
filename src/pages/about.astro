        I'm Anhad Jai Singh — a software developer by profession with a wide
        range of interests spanning finance, economics, golf, mechanical
        keyboards, watches, art, fashion, and more.

        I got into open source early, participating in Google Summer of Code
        with Mozilla in 2013 and later interning with their Release Engineering
        team in San Francisco. That experience — working on build
        infrastructure, release automation, and eventually migrating
        SpiderMonkey builds to TaskCluster — shaped a lot of how I think about
        software. I've been building things professionally ever since.

        Outside of work, I tend to go deep on whatever catches my attention.
        Right now that means a lot of time thinking about markets, tinkering
        with mechanical keyboards, playing golf (poorly but enthusiastically),
        and appreciating watches and art from a comfortable distance. I like
        understanding how things work, whether that's a financial system or a
        wristwatch movement.

        This site is my little corner of the internet — a place to write, share
        projects, and keep track of ideas. It's a work in progress, much like
        everything else.

        You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/anhadg">GitHub</a> if you want
        to see what I'm working on.
