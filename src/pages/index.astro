      Software developer. Curious about everything.
    </p>
    <div class="prose prose-stone prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
      <p>
        I'm a software developer with a wide range of interests spanning
        finance, economics, golf, mechanical keyboards, watches, art, fashion,
        and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got into open source early, participating in Google Summer of Code
        with Mozilla in 2013 and later interning with their Release Engineering
        team in San Francisco. That experience — working on build
        infrastructure, release automation, and eventually migrating
        SpiderMonkey builds to TaskCluster — shaped a lot of how I think about
        software. I've been building things professionally ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I tend to go deep on whatever catches my attention.
        Right now that means a lot of time thinking about markets, tinkering
        with mechanical keyboards, playing golf (poorly but enthusiastically),
        and appreciating watches and art from a comfortable distance. I like
        understanding how things work, whether that's a financial system or a
        wristwatch movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is my little corner of the internet — a place to write, share
        projects, and keep track of ideas. It's a work in progress, much like
        everything else.
